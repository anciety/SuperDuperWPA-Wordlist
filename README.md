# SuperDuperWPA-Wordlist

Ghello fellow hackers, you've probably come here for the big ass WPA wordlist rite?
Well, it's too big to be uploaded to GitHub but i'll provide you the link in this file but first some things you need to know:

1. The file contains 900+ million lines of words, yes 900+ million..
2. I'ts most effective if you create a rainbow table with it but note that it can take a whiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiile..
3. You can use it regurarly with aircrack without Pre-Calculating the PMK (2.) But note that it'll take a fucking while to do..

Here's the link and enjoy modafoka :)
